// Location Table Types
'NPC'
'Event' Used for trial clears
'Boss'
'Chest'
'Song'
'Fairy'
'Special' ? Used for Zelda, some fairies and Chest Game
'GS Token' Definitely won't be using
// Location Table Tuple
?, ?, ?, Type
// Item Tuple
T?F, T?F, ?, ?, ?
"advancement" - whether it's a progression item?
"priority" - same but not?
"type" - mostly None, else Map, Compass, BigKey, SmallKey, Song, Event
"code" -
"index" -
Event types need to be set in ItemList.generate_itempool
To add an item to the pool, an entry needs to exist in the ItemFactory in Items.py
Regions can specify connections, chests, npcs, songs, events,
Time might not need logical support if the fetch quest can be skipped
But for the time being, just make a time sensitive rule flag somewhere
Here's where I'll point to where it made sense to put a time flag.
(Probably in World tho, after a significant refactor)
Order:
Regions.py create region
  Per Location
    Add Location Table Entry (Regions.py)
    Add Prize to ItemList.py
    Create Items.py entry if new
  Per Exit
    Add to mandatory_connections or default_connections as necessary (EntranceShuffle.py)
Fairies are handled as interior in Regions.py, Rewards only stated as a Location for the three goddess magic items
For MM Fairies only ST will add a location, 'SF' and 'SF Chest' will be used as the in dungeon Location type for Stray Fairies
Might just poke into the dev branch to see how the fairy rewards are going to be handled
