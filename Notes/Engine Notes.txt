// Location Table Types

// Location Table Tuple
?, ?, ?, Type
// Item Tuple
T?F, T?F, ?, ?, ?
"advancement" - whether it's a progression item?
"priority" - same but not?
"type" - mostly None, else Map, Compass, BigKey, SmallKey, Song, Event
"code" -
"index" -
Event types need to be set in ItemList.generate_itempool
To add an item to the pool, an entry needs to exist in the ItemFactory in Items.py
Regions can specify connections, chests, npcs, songs, events,
Time might not need logical support if the fetch quest can be skipped
But for the time being, just make a time sensitive rule flag somewhere
Here's where I'll point to where it made sense to put a time flag.
(Probably in World tho, after a significant refactor)
