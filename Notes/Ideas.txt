The only progressives I can think of are arrows and bombs
Tho adding a progressive sword would be great, that bird is gonna pose a problem
I dunno if we'd want to remove sword/shield or just keep them.
Razor Sword will also pose issue, but if progressives end up working:
Stolen Kokiri, Stolen Razor, Stolen Gilded?, Broken Razor, Razor, Gilded, Great Fairy
Randomized Fairies could be interesting, both for the fountain and between/within Dungeons
Tingle Maps in the pool
Owl Statues an option to be in the pool
Song of Time given off the start?
