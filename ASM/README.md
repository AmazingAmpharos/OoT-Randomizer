- Download the armips assembler: <https://github.com/Kingcom/armips>, build it if necessary, and put the executable in the `tools` directory, or somewhere in your PATH
- Put the ROM you want to patch at `roms/base.z64`. This needs to be an uncompressed ROM; OoTRandomizer will produce one at ZOOTDEC.z64 when you run it with a compressed ROM.
- Run `python build.py`, which will:
  - create `roms/patched.z64`
  - update some `txt` files in `build/` and in `../data/generated/`. Check `git status` to see which ones have changed. Make sure you submit them all together!

To recompile the C modules, use the `--compile-c` option. This requires the N64 development tools to be installed: <https://github.com/glankk/n64>

To generate symbols for the Project 64 debugger, use the `--pj64sym` option:

    python build.py --pj64sym 'path_to_pj64/Saves/THE LEGEND OF ZELDA.sym'
