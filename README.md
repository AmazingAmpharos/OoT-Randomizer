## Installation

It is strongly suggested users use the web generator from here:

https://ootrandomizer.com

If you wish to run the script raw, clone this repository and either run ```Gui.py``` for a
graphical interface or ```OoTRandomizer.py``` for the command line version. They both require Python 3.6+. This will be fully featured,
but the seeds you generate will have different random factors than the bundled release.
To use the GUI, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v12, with npm) will additionally need to be installed.
The first time ```Gui.py``` is run it will need to install necessary components, which could take a few minutes. Subsequent instances will run much quicker.
Built-in WAD injection is only supported on the website. To create a WAD from a seed created locally, either use 
[gzinject](https://github.com/krimtonz/gzinject/tree/0.2.0) or output a patch file and run that through the website.

This randomizer requires The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time version ```1.0 NTSC-US```. This randomizer includes an in-built decompressor, but if
the user wishes a pre-decompressed ROM may be supplied as input. Please be sure your input ROM filename is either a .n64 or .z64 file. For users
playing via any means other than on real N64 hardware, the use of the "Compress patched ROM" flag is strongly encouraged as uncompressed ROMs are
impossible to inject for the Virtual Console and have random crashing problems on all emulators.

For general use, there are three recommended emulators: [Project 64 (v2.4+)](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Project64), [Bizhawk](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Bizhawk), and [RetroArch](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Retroarch).
In a nutshell the differences are:
* Project64 is the lightest emulator and the easiest to setup, however, you will need a stable version from 2.4 or later to run OoTR well (and earlier versions are not permitted for use in OoTR races).
* Bizhawk is the most resource-intensive, but easier to set up than RetroArch and the only race-legal emulator to support [Multiworld](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Multiworld).
* RetroArch is less resource-intensive than Bizhawk and the only of these three to work on platforms other than Windows, but it can be frustrating to set up.

Please follow [the guides on our wiki](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Setup#Emulators) carefully to ensure a stable game experience and that
[the settings requirements for races](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Racing#Emulator_Settings_Requirements) are met. OoTR can also be run on
an N64 using an [EverDrive](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Everdrive), or on Wii Virtual Console. For questions and tech support we kindly
refer you to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/q6m6kzK).

## General Description

This program takes _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ and randomizes the locations of the items for a new, more dynamic play experience.
Proper logic is used to ensure every seed is possible to complete without the use of glitches and will be safe from the possibility of softlocks with any possible usage of keys in dungeons.

The randomizer will ensure a glitchless path through the seed will exist, but the randomizer will not prevent the use of glitches for those players who enjoy that sort of thing, though we offer no guarantees that all glitches will have identical behavior to the original game.
Glitchless can still mean that clever or unintuitive strategies may be required involving the use of things like Hover Boots, the Hookshot, or other items that may not have been as important in the original game.

Each major dungeon will earn you a random Spiritual Stone or Medallion once completed.
The particular dungeons where these can be found, as well as other relevant dungeon information can be viewed in the pause menu by holding the "A" button on the C-Item Menu.
Note, however, that the unlock conditions for dungeon information are settings-dependent.

As a service to the player in this very long game, many cutscenes have been greatly shortened or removed, and text is as often as possible either omitted or sped up. It is likely that someone somewhere will miss the owl's interjections; to that person, I'm sorry I guess?

### Getting Stuck

With a game the size of _Ocarina of Time_, it's quite easy for new Randomizer players to get stuck in certain situations with no apparent path to progressing. 
Before reporting an issue, please make sure to check out [our Logic wiki page](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Logic). 
We also have many community members who can help out in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8nmX7fa).

### Settings

The OoT Randomizer offers many different settings to customize your play experience.
A comprehensive list can be found [here](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Readme).

#### Plandomizer

"Plan"-domizer is a feature that gives some additional control over the seed generation using a separate distribution file. In such a file you can:
* Place items at specific locations or restrict items from being placed at specific locations.
* Add or remove items from the item pool.
* Select items to start with.
* Set specific dungeons to be vanilla vs Master Quest.
* Set which trials are required.
* Set any regular settings.

Caveat: Plandomizer settings will override most settings in the main OoTR generator settings, particularly list-based settings like enabled tricks or starting inventory. For example, if the Plandomizer distribution file contains an empty list of starting items, and the generator settings include additional starting equipment, the player will start with none of them instead. You will have to edit the Plandomizer file to change such settings, or **delete** completely the line in the Plandomizer file with the given setting to allow the main generator to alter the setting.

See [the Plandomizer wiki page](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Plandomizer) for full details.

### Known issues

Unfortunately, a few known issues exist. These will hopefully be addressed in future versions.

* The fishing minigame sometimes refuses to allow you to catch fish when playing specifically on Bizhawk. Save and Hard Reset (NOT savestate) and return to fix the
issue. You should always Hard Reset to avoid this issue entirely.
* Versions older than 2.4 of Project64 have known compatablity issues with OoTR. To avoid this either 
[update to v2.4 and follow the rest of our PJ64 guide](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Project64) or change to one of our other two supported emulators.
* Executing the collection delay glitch on various NPCs may have unpredictable and undesirable consequences.
* Saving and quitting on the very first frame after becoming an adult when you would trigger the Light Arrow cutscene can have undesired consequences. Just don't
do that.
* This randomizer is based on the 1.0 version of _Ocarina of Time_, so some of its specific bugs remain.

## Changelog

### Dev

#### Bug Fixes

### 6.0

#### New Features

  * Allows configuring how the Kakariko Gate and the Happy Mask Shop will open.
  * Default (vanilla) behavior requires showing Zelda's Letter to the guard to open the gate and the shop.
  * You can configure the gate to be always open or to open automatically upon obtaining the Letter. Both of these options will also open the Happy Mask Shop upon obtaining the Letter.
* Entrance Randomizer settings overhaul
  * `Entrance Shuffle` setting replaced with the other independent settings here.
  * `Shuffle Interior Entrances`: allows a choice of shuffling simple interiors, all interiors, or none.

  * All these shuffles and randomizations are fixed when the seed is generated; within a seed it will always be the same each time.
* New options for `Shuffle Songs`
  * This now allows selecting from three options: shuffling in **song** locations (previously 'off'), shuffling in **anywhere** (previously 'on'), and shuffling in **dungeon** reward locations (new).
  * The dungeon reward locations are: the 9 boss heart containers, the Lens of Truth chest (BotW), the Ice Arrows chest (GTG), the song reward in Ice Cavern, and the song from Impa in Hyrule Castle.
  * In multiworld, as before, only the "anywhere" setting will allow songs to be placed in other players' worlds.
* New setting `Shuffle Medigoron & Carpet Salesman`
  * Adds the Giant's Knife and a pack of Bombchus to the pool while Medigoron and Carpet Salesman each sell a randomly placed item once for 200 rupees.
* New options for Key and Map/Compass Shuffle settings
  * "Overworld Only" will place keys (or maps/compasses) outside of dungeons.

  * "Dungeon Only" is renamed "Own Dungeon" for clarity.
  * Gerudo Fortress Small Keys are configured in a separate setting.
* New options for `Rainbow Bridge` and `Ganon's Boss Key on Light Arrows Cut Scene`.
  * Sliders allow customizing the exact number of stones/medallions/dungeons/tokens required.
  * Ganon's BK on LACS can now be set to require Gold Skulltula Tokens.
  * `Randomize Main Rules` won't randomize slider values.
  * Conditional-always hints check for whether 2 or more dungeon rewards are required, as a backstop.

##### 'Other' settings
* New setting `Skip Child Zelda`
  * Skips the Hyrule Castle visit as child, returning Malon and Talon to Lon Lon Ranch and granting Zelda's Letter and the song that Impa provides at the start of the game.

* New setting `Fast Bunny Hood`
  * Allows manual toggling on/off of the 1.5x speed boost from MM.
* New "Hint Distribution" customization options
  * Old hardcoded hint distributions are now defined by json files in `data/Hints`.
  * Custom hint distributions can be added to this folder, or defined directly in Plando files.
  * Many locations that did not previously have item hints now have hints, in case a custom hint distribution makes use of them.
  * Using the hint distribution "Bingo" allows setting a "Bingosync URL" to build hints for the specific OoTR Bingo board. Otherwise it's a generic hint distribution for OoTR Bingo.
* Hint distributions can configure groups of stones to all have the same hint, and can also disable stones from receiving useful hints (give them junk hints instead).
* Tournament hint distribution changes
  * Grotto stones are disabled and only provide junk hints.
  * Zelda's Lullaby is never considered for Way of the Hero hints.
  * Only "always", "Barren", and "WotH" hints have duplicates now.
  * "Barren" hints will typically be split evenly between dungeon and overworld areas.
  * Number of unique hints of each type are now (not counting seed-dependent hint types like 'always' and 'trial'): 4 WotH, 2 barren, 5(remainder) sometimes.
  * The previous Tournament hint distribution has been renamed "Scrubs Tournament".
* New setting `Hero Mode`
  * Allows playing without heart drops from enemies or objects. Good luck!!

##### Cosmetics/SFX
* New cosmetic settings for HUD button colors
  * These can all be set independently, defaulting to the N64 colors.

#### Updated Settings/Tricks
* `Lens of Truth` setting has been removed and replaced with several independent tricks.
  * `Lensless Wasteland`: assumes you can navigate the Wasteland to the Colossus without the Lens of Truth.
  * `<Area> without Lens of Truth`: assumes you can complete the given area without the Lens of Truth. Note that MQ and Vanilla dungeons have separate tricks.
  * Shadow Temples are split into two separate areas for these tricks.
  * Glitchless logic now requires Lens (or an appropriate trick) for some checks, particularly in Shadow Temple.
  * Glitched logic may sometimes assume you can do something without lens regardless of trick settings.

### 5.2

#### New Features
* Triforce Hunt
  * Collect some number of Triforce Pieces to beat the game instead of beating Ganon.
  * Multiworld Triforce counts are collective, so once the total is reached across all players everyone wins.
  * If enabled via randomizing main rules, the count is always 20.
* Separate Double Defense model
  * Now appears as a color-shifted version of the Heart Container, with a transparent interior and prominent gold border.
* Visual Stone of Agony indicator
  * When the player has the Stone of Agony, it will appear on-screen above the rupee count when the player is near a hidden grotto.
  * The icon vibrates based on proximity to the grotto entrance, similar to the rumble pak.
  * A real rumble pak is not required.
* Starting Inventory
  * A new tab in the GUI allows setting initial inventory, without having to create a Plandomizer file.
  * Items are divided into sections in the GUI based on category.
  * Trade quest items, Gerudo Membership Card, Scarecrow Song not included.
    * To start with the Gerudo Membership Card, set `Gerudo Fortress` to `Open Fortress` and disable `Shuffle Gerudo Card` ('Main Rules' tab).
    * To start with the Scarecrow Song, enable `Free Scarecrow's Song` ('Other' tab).

#### Updated Settings 
* Open Zora Fountain now has an open only adult option.
* Added a new setting `Ice Trap Appearance` to select whether ice traps appear as major items (the default), junk items, or anything. This appearance can affect chest size with `Chest Size Matches Contents` enabled.
* Removed settings `Start with Fast Travel`, `Start with Tycoon's Wallet`, `Start with Deku Equipment`.
  * These have been replaced with settings in the "Starting Inventory" tab.
* New settings `Start with Consumables` (enable to start with max Sticks, Nuts, and ammo), `Starting Hearts` (changes starting max health).
* New list settings `Starting Equipment` (swords, shields, strength, etc.), `Starting Items` (c-items), `Starting Songs` (songs).
* Logic now requires Stone of Agony to access any hidden grotto.
  * A new trick `Hidden Grottos without Stone of Agony` will bypass this.
  * Stone of Agony is now only considered a useless item (for barren areas) when this trick is on and Gossip Stones do not use it.
* Added a new trick `Goron City Spinning Pot PoH with Strength`, which allows stopping the Spinning Pot using a bomb flower.
* Hell Mode preset includes both the above tricks.
* Tricks enabled/disabled in a Plandomizer file now take precedence over Tricks in 'Detailed Logic', even if the Plandomizer file has an empty list.
  * An empty list means the seed will be beatable without any tricks.
  * If there's no `allowed_tricks` item in the file, the Detailed Logic tricks apply instead.
  * If there is an `allowed_tricks` list in the file, it will not be possible to disable any of the enabled tricks (or enabling more) without editing the file.

#### Other Changes
* Cosmetic heart color setting now applies in the file select screen.
* Cosmetic tunic color setting now applies to the icons in the pause menu.
* Non-Always Location hints cannot be placed for an area that already has a Foolish hint.
  * If the location hint is placed first, then it can still appear in a foolish hinted area, however in Tournament hint distribution the Foolish hints are placed first so that cannot happen.

* Ganondorf no longer hints at his Boss Key chest contents, except when Light Arrows don't exist (only possible in Triforce Hunt).
* Improved Entrance Randomizer hints.
* Updated Compressor. The GUI progress bar is now granular. If for some reason, the rom won't fit into 32MB, then the compressor will increase the output size.
* Revised some settings tooltips.
* Refactored Logic once again. It now uses helper json rules and rules can reference other rules.
* Disabled settings don't show up in the spoiler.

  * Attempts to not exceed item pool values until all the pool counts for the items in the list are reached.
* Plando locations are matched without regard to case.
* "Start with" settings are now handled by the Plando library.
* Further seed generation speed improvements.
* The main search algorithm was renamed Search (from Playthrough) to avoid confusion with the spoiler playthrough.
* General code cleanup and typo fixes.
* Added more Plando unittests.

* Spoilers for plando'd seeds now correctly show the tricks enabled for the seed.
* Plando no longer occasionally attempts to place an item on a location where it's not allowed.
* Plando starting items and items set in specific locations now count toward the pool allocation. (Starting items are replaced with junk.)

* Removed (unnecessarily) duplicated/overlapping hints.
* Hints that should come in multiples (duplicates) no longer come in singletons in certain corner cases.

* Removed a misleading random "trials" value from the non-randomized settings in the spoiler.
* Fix seed values with spaces no longer working.
* Removed a mispasted option description from Gauntlets colors tooltips.
* Major armips fix should prevent some crashes in Dev builds. (Devs: required armips version >= 0.10.0-68-g8669ffd)
