## Installation

It is strongly suggested users use the web generator from here:

https://ootrandomizer.com

If you wish to run the script raw, clone this repository and either run ```Gui.py``` for a
graphical interface or ```OoTRandomizer.py``` for the command line version. They both require Python 3.6+. This will be fully featured,
but the seeds you generate will have different random factors than the bundled release.

This randomizer requires The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time version ```1.0 NTSC-US```. This randomizer includes an in-built decompressor, but if
the user wishes a pre-decompressed ROM may be supplied as input. Please be sure your input ROM filename is either a .n64 or .z64 file. For users
playing via any means other than on real N64 hardware, the use of the "Compress patched ROM" flag is strongly encouraged as uncompressed ROMs are
impossible to inject for the Virtual Console and have random crashing problems on all emulators.

For general use, the recommended emulator is RetroArch; it has been shown to work with minimal issues. Bizhawk and Mupen64plus are generally good choices
too. If you want to play on Project 64 for whatever reason, you can, but you will need to set the rando to use 8 MB of RAM and will want to play with the
cheat code ```8109C58A 0000``` to partially fix Project 64's tragically poor handling of OoT's pause menu. Project 64 also has one particular crash that only
happens for some unknown settings configurations; we cannot support this. We cannot emphasize enough that it is a discouraged emulator to use.

## General Description

This program takes _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ and randomizes the locations of the items for a new, more dynamic play experience.
Proper logic is used to ensure every seed is possible to complete without the use of glitches and will be safe from the possibility of softlocks with any possible usage of keys in dungeons.

The randomizer will ensure a glitchless path through the seed will exist, but the randomizer will not prevent the use of glitches for those players who enjoy that sort of thing though we offer no guarantees that all glitches will have identical behavior to the original game.
Glitchless can still mean that clever or unintuitive strategies may be required involving the use of things like Hover Boots, the Hookshot, or other items that may not have been as important in the original game.

Each major dungeon will earn you a random Spiritual Stone or Medallion once completed.
The particular dungeons where these can be found, as well as other relevant dungeon inforomation can be viewed in the pause menu by holding the "A" button on the C-Item Menu.

As a service to the player in this very long game, many cutscenes have been greatly shortened, and text is as often as possible either omitted or sped up. It is likely that someone somewhere will miss the owl's interjections; to that person, I'm sorry I guess?

### Getting Stuck

With a game the size of _Ocarina of Time_, it's quite easy for new Randomizer players to get stuck in certain situations with no apparent path to progressing. Before reporting an issue, please make sure to check out [our Logic wiki page](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Logic).

### Settings

The OoT Randomizer offers many different settings to customize your play experience.
A comprehensive list can be found [here](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Readme).

### Known issues

Unfortunately, a few known issues exist. These will hopefully be addressed in future versions.

* The fishing minigame sometimes refuses to allow you to catch fish when playing specifically on Bizhawk. Save and Hard Reset (NOT savestate) and return to fix the
issue. You should always Hard Reset to avoid this issue entirely.
* Draining the Bottom of the Well with Song of Storms sometimes crashes on specific configurations of Project 64. We aren't sure of the exact story, but this bug is
easily avoided by playing on a different emulator and probably also avoidable by changing your settings and maybe graphics plug-in.
* Executing the collection delay glitch on various NPCs may have unpredictable and undesirable consequences.
* Saving and quitting on the very first frame after becoming an adult when you would trigger the Light Arrow cutscene can have undesired consequences. Just don't
do that.
* This randomizer is based on the 1.0 version of _Ocarina of Time_, so some of its specific bugs remain. Some of these like "empty bomb" can be disadvantagous to the
player.

## Changelog

#### New Features
* Triforce Hunt
  * Collect some number of Triforce Pieces to beat the game instead of beating Ganon
  * Multiworld Triforce counts are collective, so once the total is reached across all players everyone wins.
  * If enabled via randomizing main rules, the count is always 20.
* Separate Double Defense model
  * Now appears as a color-shifted version of the Heart Container, with a transparent interior and prominent gold border.
* Visual Stone of Agony indicator
  * When the player has the Stone of Agony, it will appear on-screen above the rupee count when the player is near a hidden grotto.
  * The icon vibrates based on proximity to the grotto entrance, similar to the rumble pak.
  * A real rumble pak is not required.

#### Updated Settings 
* Open Zora Fountain now has an open only adult option.
* Added a new setting `Ice Trap Appearance` to select whether ice traps appear as major items (the default), junk items, or anything. This appearance does not presently affect chest size with Chest Size Matches Contents enabled, due to a bug.
* Logic now requires Stone of Agony to access any hidden grotto.
  * A new trick `Hidden Grottos without Stone of Agony` will bypass this.
  * Stone of Agony is now only considered a useless item (for barren areas) when this trick is on and Gossip Stones do not use it.
* Added a new trick `Goron City Spinning Pot PoH without Explosives`, which allows stopping the Spinning Pot using a bomb flower.
* Hell Mode preset includes both the above tricks.
* Tricks enabled/disabled in a Plandomizer file now take precedence over Tricks in Detailed Logic, even if the Plandomizer file has an empty list.
  * An empty list means the seed will be beatable without any tricks.
  * If there's no `allowed_tricks` item in the file, the Detailed Logic tricks apply instead.
  * If there is an `allowed_tricks` list in the file, it will not be possible to disable any of the enabled tricks (or enabling more) without editing the file.

#### Other Changes
* Cosmetic heart color setting now applies in the file select screen.
* Cosmetic tunic color setting now applies to the icons in the pause menu.
* Non-Always Location hints cannot be placed for an area that already has a Foolish hint.
  * If the location hint is placed first, then it can still appear in a foolish hinted area, however in Tournament hint distribution the Foolish hints are placed first so that cannot happen.
* The location containing Light Arrows will be considered a hinted location if Ganondorf's hint can be reached without them.
* Ganondorf no longer hints at his Boss Key chest contents.
* Improved Entrance Randomizer hints.
* Updated Compressor. The GUI progress bar is now granular. If for some reason, the rom won't fit into 32MB, then the compressor will increase the output size.
* Refactored Logic once again. It now uses helper json rules and rules can reference other rules.
* Disabled settings don't show up in the spoiler.
* Plando will now accept JSON lists for `item` in the location dictionary to randomly choose between for placement.
  * Attempts to not exceed item pool values until all the pool counts for the items in the list are reached.
* "Start with" settings are now handled by the Plando library.
* Further seed generation speed improvements.
* The main search algorithm was renamed Search (from Playthrough) to avoid confusion with the spoiler playthrough.

#### Bug Fixes
* Minor stability fix in Plando
* Spoilers for plando'd seeds now correctly show the tricks enabled for the seed.
* Plando no longer occasionally attempts to place an item on a location where it's not allowed.
* Plando starting items and items set in specific locations now count toward the pool allocation. (Starting items are replaced with junk.)
* Plando now refuses to place more than the maximum amount of bottles, adult trade items, shop items, or total non-junk items.
* Starting items for adult that auto-equip should do so correctly now. (Non-Kokiri Tunics won't autoequip at the moment.)
* Fixed two chests in MQ Shadow Temple that had swapped names in plando and spoilers.
* Removed (unnecessarily) duplicated/overlapping hints.
* Hints that should come in multiples (duplicates) no longer come in singletons in certain corner cases.
* Randomizing main rules now works correctly.
* Removed a misleading random "trials" value from the non-randomized settings in the spoiler.
* Fix seed values with spaces no longer working.
* Miscellaneous logic fixes.
* Other bug fixes.
